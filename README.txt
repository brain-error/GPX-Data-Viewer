## Installation of Node App

### 1. Install

# From the root of the directory
npm install


### 2. Running Server

# PORT is your personally given port number, e.g. 1234
npm run dev PORT
# Server will be accessible at http://localhost:PORT

-------------------------------------Additional Points-------------------------------------
* Run the server inside the GPXApp/ directory

* To Makefile, proceed into ./parser

* The gpx.xsd file MUST remain in GPXApp in order for the website to function
  (there was no mention of this in the documentation, therefore I assume it is okay)

* When using buttons (Add Route, Rename, Create GPX) that open up a pop-up form, please CLOSE the pop-up menu before continuing/clicking other buttons

* Please do not touch my assets folder that is located in public as it includes images for my header

* Tables and drop-down menus should refresh on their own, but if no visible change is seen PLEASE REFRESH THE PAGE before assuming tables were not updated
